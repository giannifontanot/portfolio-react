                          <p>Hi there! My name is Gianni Fontanot, and I have been programming computers in many languages since
                              1998.
                              Back then I was working with now old technologies like PowerDynamo, Internet Information Server, and
                              the Sybase database ... (have you ever heard of any of them?) and later with a much more modern set of
                              languages as a Full Stack Java Web Developer with Java EE and SQL. </p>
                          <p>In 2011, I did an
                              intermission and
                              decided to come
                              to the United States to teach children in a bilingual classroom, and for ten years I enjoyed doing it.
                              Now, after getting acquainted by the excellent SMU Bootcamp instructors about the new technologies developed in
                              recent years, I am ready to get back to coding!</p>
